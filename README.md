This is my project work, trying to add elastic container feature to Yarn. According to the experiment result, elastic will bring some benefit especially when long running services are in cluster.

The building method is just like original Yarn. The document of my work is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8qgvnezbp6eidj/Elastic-Yarn-Container-Implementation.pdf?dl=0).
